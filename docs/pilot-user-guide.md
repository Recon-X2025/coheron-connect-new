# Coheron ERP — Pilot User Guide

## What is Coheron ERP?

Coheron ERP is a cloud-based business management platform that brings your sales, inventory, accounting, HR, projects, support, manufacturing, and more into a single connected system. Instead of juggling separate tools, your teams work from one place with shared data and real-time updates.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have feedback during the pilot:

1. Note what you were doing, what you expected, and what happened instead.
2. Include the module name and any error messages you see on screen.
3. Report via the channel your administrator has designated (email, shared tracker, or the Support module's internal ticketing).

Your feedback directly shapes what gets fixed and improved before general availability.
